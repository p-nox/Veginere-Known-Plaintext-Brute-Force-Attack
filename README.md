# Simple Substitution Cipher Cracker

## Overview
This Python script implements a brute-force approach to crack a simple substitution cipher. It takes a ciphertext and a known plaintext as input, along with the assumed key length. The script then generates all possible keys of the specified length and decrypts the ciphertext using each key until it finds a match with the known plaintext.

## Features
- Brute-force approach to crack simple substitution cipher
- Supports variable key length
- Reports the total time taken and the number of attempts made
- Example provided with encrypted message and known plaintext

## Usage
1. Input the ciphertext, known plaintext, and key length.
2. Run the script to perform the brute-force attack.
3. The script will output the decrypted message along with information about the cracking process.
